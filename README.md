A learning management system (LMS) is a software application or web-based technology that is used to manage, carry out, and evaluate a particular learning activity. It is used for eLearning procedures and, in its most basic configuration, consists of two components: a server that handles the essential functions and a user interface that is controlled by teachers, learners, and administrators.
