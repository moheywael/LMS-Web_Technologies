### Importing SCSS Files Approaches!
<!-- --- -->
we can include _index.scss in each sass structure file and import all folder sass files into it with scss {@forward}. And import the Index file into the main scss file ***that help us to write less code into our main.scss***. My usual Approach is including each scss file seperatly in my main scss file.
